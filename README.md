This is my submission for the Mini Holiday Hackathon 2024 organized by Codedex for track number 2. 
This website is heavily inspired by neocity websites. I have always adored the work on neocity and I am so happy that I got a chance to create my own little corner on the web. 
I hope this webpage is as memorable to you guys as it was for me. This website was build using HTML, CSS and JS.
